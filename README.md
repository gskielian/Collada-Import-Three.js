How to load a 3D image with Three.js
===================================

The entire three.js library is huge, so in order make this goal more manageable I removed everything except what is needed for loading a collada image (a type of 3d image) into a website.

Select "Fork" on the top right to get your own copy this repository and start modifying the [webgl_loader_collada.html](webgl_loader_collada.html).

If viewing does not work locally on your computer, try selecting the "raw" version of the webgl_loader_collada.html code, and deleting the period after raw and pressing enter: raw.github... -> rawgithub

This should render your page in your browser.
