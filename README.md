How to load a 3D image with Three.js
===================================

The entire three.js library is huge, so in order make this goal more manageable I removed everything except what is needed for loading a collada image (a type of 3d image) into a website.

Options
-------


1. git clone onto your computer 
  * `git clone 
2. Downloading as a Zip File and editing locally
3. Getting your own github copy of this repo and editing directly on github;
  * Select "Fork" on the top right to get your own copy this repository and start modifying the [webgl_loader_collada.html](webgl_loader_collada.html).



 

Viewing Your File:
------------------
If viewing does not work locally on your computer, try selecting the "raw" version of the webgl_loader_collada.html code, and deleting the period after raw and pressing enter: raw.github... -> rawgithub

This should render your page in your browser.
